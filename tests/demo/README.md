# TemplateX Demo Seed — Fashion HR Profiles (DE)

A repeatable, fully synthetic demo set for TemplateX. Running a single PHP
script produces:

- 2 **Word templates** (`demo-template1.docx`, `demo-template2.docx`) with
  every `{{placeholder}}` from [`example-variables.md`](./example-variables.md)
- 2 **Collections** (executive vs. retail) defined in
  [`collections.json`](./collections.json)
- 6 **Datasets / candidates** with fictional German fashion-industry
  positions, salaries, career stations and benefits
- 6 **filled DOCX** files in `filled/` — one per candidate, rendered through
  the same expansion primitives the real TemplateXController uses
  (row cloning for `{{stations.*.N}}`, list expansion, checkbox toggling,
  station-details block parsing)

No data is copied from customer artifacts — the templates are rebuilt from
scratch via PhpWord with a neutral HR-profile layout.

## Contents

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `seed-demo.php` | Step 1 — builds the demo files on disk (offline, no Synaplan required). |
| `install-demo.php` | Step 2 — pushes the demo into a running Synaplan + TemplateX through the HTTP API. |
| `example-variables.md` | Reference of all `{{placeholders}}`, grouped by type (scalar, list, checkbox, optional, station). |
| `demo-template1.docx` | Executive / Senior Fashion profile (full layout). |
| `demo-template2.docx` | Retail Store Manager profile (compact layout, same placeholders). |
| `collections.json` | Machine-readable export: the 2 Collections + 6 Datasets. Consumed by `install-demo.php`. |
| `filled/*.docx` | One rendered DOCX per candidate (offline reference render). |

All 6 candidates are fictional. Any similarity to real persons is coincidental.

## How to run

There are two steps — **seed-demo.php just produces files on disk; it does
not touch your running Synaplan**. To see the two Collections and their
candidates appear in the plugin UI, run the installer as the second step.

### 1) Generate the files (offline)

```bash
# From the templatex repo root:
php tests/demo/seed-demo.php
```

The script auto-detects PhpWord from (in order):

1. `/wwwroot/synaplan/backend/vendor/autoload.php` (workspace Synaplan install)
2. `/var/www/backend/vendor/autoload.php` (docker-internal path used by the
   existing `tests/fixtures/create_template.php`)
3. `vendor/autoload.php` (local composer install, if present)

It needs **only** PhpWord for template construction. The fill step uses
pure PHP (`ZipArchive` + regex) and mirrors the same primitives the Phase A
and Phase B regression tests exercise.

### 2) Install into your running Synaplan

```bash
# Requires Synaplan running locally (default: http://localhost:8000)
php tests/demo/install-demo.php

# Useful options:
#   --wipe      delete any previously installed [FashionDemo] records first
#   --generate  ask the plugin to render each candidate's DOCX in-app too
#               (so filled documents appear under each candidate's Documents tab)
php tests/demo/install-demo.php --wipe --generate
```

Environment overrides (all have sensible defaults for a local dev instance):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SYNAPLAN_API_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Base URL of the Synaplan backend |
| `SYNAPLAN_USER_ID` | `1` | User ID that owns the demo records |
| `SYNAPLAN_ADMIN_EMAIL` | `admin@synaplan.com` | Login email |
| `SYNAPLAN_ADMIN_PASS` | `admin123` | Login password |

The installer:

1. Logs in and stores the auth cookie.
2. Uploads `demo-template1.docx` and `demo-template2.docx` through
   `POST /templates` (with `[FashionDemo]` tags so `--wipe` can find them).
3. Creates the 2 Collections through `POST /forms` with properly typed
   `fields[]` (text / select / list / table with columns — the `stations`
   table is a proper repeating group with `employer`, `time`, `positions`,
   `details` columns).
4. Creates each candidate through `POST /candidates` with `field_values`
   pre-filled (scalars, lists, the `stations` table, plus `moving` /
   `commute` / `travel` as `Ja`/`Nein`).
5. Calls `PUT /candidates/{id}/variables` so the overrides win over any
   future source-routing changes.
6. Optionally (`--generate`) calls `POST /candidates/{id}/generate/{templateId}`
   so the plugin renders each candidate in-app using its own engine. After
   that, every candidate shows a completed document in its Documents tab.

Open `/plugins/templatex` in the UI after step 2 — the two
`[FashionDemo]` collections and their 6 candidates will be visible.

## Relation to production TemplateXController

The fill routine in `seed-demo.php` is intentionally a standalone clone of
the controller's expansion logic — identical to what
`tests/phase-a-lists.php` and `tests/phase-b-stations.php` already inline.
That keeps the demo self-contained and lets it run offline, without
Symfony/Docker.

When you feed `collections.json` into a real TemplateX instance (through
the plugin's `POST /forms` and `POST /candidates` endpoints), the real
controller will produce equivalent DOCX output.

## Regenerating

Re-run `php tests/demo/seed-demo.php` any time. The script is idempotent:
it overwrites the templates, the manifest and every filled document.

## Why two templates

The original customer has "2+ templates" as a requirement. To prove that
TemplateX handles both an elaborate executive layout _and_ a compact
retail layout on the **same variable set**, Collection A points at
`demo-template1.docx` and Collection B at `demo-template2.docx`. The
variable catalogue is identical — only the layout differs.
